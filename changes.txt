Moved the screen border to Z-layer 100 (the powerups were displaying on top of it)

Mines now explode (after a very brief delay) when they are near other exploding mines
- This also happens when they are shot now, instead of the immediate explosion

Bullets no longer turn when they hit a mine unless the mine exploded near it
- They shoot away from the mine in this case

Tweaked player death particles and sound
